# StarBucks-Project
This is the repo of StarBucks project in Udacity ML Nanodegree.

## 1. Project Overview

The objective of the venture is to manufacture an AI model that can be utilized inside web application to handle genuine world, clients. I’d be focusing on creating an optimal model that would yield correct predictions on the dataset, that is to check if a particular offer is suitable for a customer or not.

## 2. Libraries Used

pandas
numpy
json
math
datetime
matplotlib.pyplot
seaborn
warnings
sklearn.ensemble (AdaBoostClassifier,RandomForestClassifier,GradientBoostingClassifier,ExtraTreesClassifier)
sklearn.model_selection (train_test_split,GridSearchCV)
sklearn.neighbors (KNeighborsClassifier)

## 3. Project Motivation


This project is the Capstone project of my Data Scientist nanodegree with Udacity. As students in the nanodegree, we have the option to take part in the Starbucks Capstone Challenge. For the challenge, Udacity provided simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app.

## 4. Files
The data used in the project is in the files portfolio.json, profile.json and transcript.json. Starbucks .ipynb File.

## 5. Results and Discussion

The model made utilizing Extra Trees Classifier has an accuracy of 99.2% on training data. The complexity of transcript dataset can be attributed to this. Therefore, I suggest that accuracy of 65% is ok, though we can improvise but that is by utilising more complex algorithms. Owing to the complexity of the dataset one can expect the test accuracy of the model to be around 60%. This model is basically about sending offers to people, so this amount of accuracy is fair enough.
